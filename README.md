# 🕶️ AnonBoard — A Minimalist Anonymous Social Platform

Welcome to **AnonBoard**, a lightweight social media experiment that lets users anonymously post text and image content — no usernames, no filters, no followers — just pure, chaotic expression 🌀

Inspired by **Reddit's community vibe** and **Instagram's image feed**, AnonBoard merges both into one anonymous board.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Clean home feed with anonymous posts  
✅ Supports **text**, **photos**, or both  
✅ Bootstrap-powered responsive layout  
✅ Tabs for:
- 🏠 Home (all posts)
- 💬 Text-only posts
- 📸 Image-only posts
- ➕ Post creation form

✅ Posts stored in **SQLite** for simplicity  
✅ Fully built using **Python Flask** + **Jinja2 Templates**

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to create something fun, chaotic, and anonymous — kinda like Reddit and Instagram had a secret baby 👶

This project is also helping me learn full-stack basics, improve my Python/Flask skills, and experiment with frontend layout and Jinja templating.
